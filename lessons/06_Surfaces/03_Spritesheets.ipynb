    "A videogame will involve a lot of images. When you have an animated character,\n",
    "each different pose will be a different image, and so many images can be\n",
    "dificult to manage. One way to manage this is to put all the images in a single\n",
    "image, called a spritesheet. This way, you can load a single image and then\n",
    "select the part of the image that you want to show.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what a spritesheet looks like: \n",
    "\n",
    "![spritesheet](images/spritesheet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Frogger spritesheet is from [DeviantArt user SketchBattleArt](https://www.deviantart.com/sketchbattleart/art/Frogger-Sprite-sheet-701348142)\n",
    "\n",
    "This spritesheet is for the game Frogger. Each sprite on it is 16x16 pixels, and\n",
    "if you want to load them, you have to have code that will extract the correct\n",
    "part of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have some code that will do that, in the module jtlgames.spritesheets`. This\n",
    "code will load the image and then extract the correct part of the image. Here is\n",
    "an example of how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pygame\n",
    "from jtlgames.spritesheet import SpriteSheet\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "\n",
    "# Need to initialiaze Pygame first. \n",

    "# Load a single sprite at index 0\n",
    "sprite = spritesheet.image_at( 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load a strip of 3 sprites starting at index 1\n",
    "sprite_strip = spritesheet.load_strip(1, 3, colorkey=-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SpriteSheet constructor, the first parameter is the path to the image,\n",
    "The second, like `(16, 16)`, is the size of each sprite in the spritesheet. When\n",
    "you create a SpriteSheet object, you you might have to guess at these.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `colorkey` parameter is the color that will be transparent. The value -1\n",
    "means to use the color of the top-left pixel as the transparent color. It\n",
    "defaults to -1 so you can usually leave it off. \n",
